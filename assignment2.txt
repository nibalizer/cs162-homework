1) Algorithm for learning a new syntax

* Read the english description of what the syntax does
* Look at the prototype for the syntax
* Look at several fleshed out examples of the syntax
* Repeat these three steps twice
* Implement the syntax 3 times, refering to the docs when neccessary


2) Loop invariant - something that is the same through all iterations of the
loop
   Side Effects - a change that was made inside a function that operated on
neither the arguments nor the return value. Printing to standard out is kind of
a side effect
   Modular programming - Breaking the program into logical blocks, and giving
those blocks structured interfaces. The code inside the block can be
reconfigured without changing the behavior and other sections of code won't need
to be modified.


3) Ethics:

I would limit exposure to customer data by limiting the data that I store. I
dont need the full biography of the customer, I only need a few critical pieces
of information. I would separate the locations of this data. So one database
server would have the credit card numbers, and the other database server would
have the names, addresses and such. I would hash all passwords. I would salt all
passwords.

4) Programming
