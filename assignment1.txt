Algorithm


* For each week, log into D2L every Tuesday and Thursday night to check for
important updates and watch the videos.
* On Sundays, do the week's assignment and lab.
If I can't get the lab to work or I am having trouble with the assignment, go to the 
CS Tutors on Monday.
*One week before an exam(midterm and final), spend 1 hour each night reviewing course materials and any study guide provided.


Ethics

I think it is unethical to hide a persons information from them. However, it is
also a liability to store that information. Many sites, especially hugely popular
ones, have a lot to lose in the event of a 'hack'. I think that the customer
should be able to see 100% of the information a company has on that customer.
And I believe that the company should be able to delete that information if they
want to.
